# AnnoyingEx

## Developer: Eric Ng

### Description:
**AnnoyingEx** is an app that constantly notifies you with the messages you always wanted from an Ex like: "hey you up?, "wyd", "i miss you", "can we talk", "i still love you", "plz unblock me, "Netflix n chill?", and many more. The app will constantly send notifications to you even when the application is not currently running. It is perfect for if you do not have anyone sliding into the DMs, simulating what it would be like to have a crazy ex send you messages every 20 minutes. This service can be stopped upon pressing the "block" button.
